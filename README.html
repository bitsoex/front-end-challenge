<h1 id="hibitsofam">Hi Bitso fam!</h1>

<p>I present to you, my best effort:</p>

<h1 id="usingscssinsteadofless">Using SCSS instead of LESS</h1>

<p>The main reason for this decision is because I wanted to use Bootstrap 4 to use their grid and reuse their functions/mixins for the responsive breakpoints.</p>

<h1 id="responsivefeatures">Responsive features</h1>

<p>I created a responsive menu with 3 principal buttons: Account, Exchange and Wallet because those are the most requried sections for a user, any other section could be added inside Account (such as log out, etc.).</p>

<p>Please notice Bid and Ask responsive tables, they only show the minimum required columns for a user using an smartphone.</p>

<p>In the top left menu you will be able to open &#8220;Markets&#8221; menu wich is something really important for a exchange user.</p>

<h1 id="otherthoughts">Other thoughts</h1>

<p>Sorry for not using React, I&#8217;m currently learning React JS using a course from Platzi.</p>

<p>Please consider and review my application.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Carlos Gonz√°lez.</p>
