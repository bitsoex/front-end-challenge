# Hi Bitso fam!

I present to you, my best effort:

# Using SCSS instead of LESS

The main reason for this decision is because I wanted to use Bootstrap 4 to use their grid and reuse their functions/mixins for the responsive breakpoints.

# Responsive features

I created a responsive menu with 3 principal buttons: Account, Exchange and Wallet because those are the most requried sections for a user, any other section could be added inside Account (such as log out, etc.).

Please notice Bid and Ask responsive tables, they only show the minimum required columns for a user using an smartphone.

In the top left menu you will be able to open "Markets" menu wich is something really important for a exchange user.

# Other thoughts

Sorry for not using React, I'm currently learning React JS using a course from Platzi.

Please consider and review my application.

Regards,

Carlos Gonz√°lez.
